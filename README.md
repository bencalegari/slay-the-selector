# slay-the-selector (A for of Keycuts, a Slay the Spire mod by test447)

Slay the Spire has a wonderful feature called `Card Quick Select Keys` that lets you use your keyboard to select cards in combat. However, despite this amazing addition, the rest of Slay the Spire's interfaces must still be navigated with the player's mouse.

KeyCuts allows the player to navigate the rest of the game's interfaces with just their `Card Quick Select Keys` in order to speed up gameplay in places like stores, dialogs, card selection, and combat rewards.

The goal of this fork is to allow you to select yourself or enemies with those cards via keyboard along with everything else. 

## Features

KeyCuts does not add any new hotkeys to your Slay the Spire game. It simply makes your existing hotkeys more powerful by allowing your `End Turn` and `Card Quick Select Keys` to do so much more.

1. Choose dialog options in events with `Card Quick Select Keys`.
2. Make card choices with `Card Quick Select Keys`.
3. Choose post-combat rewards with `Card Quick Select Keys`.
4. Choose rest-site options with `Card Quick Select Keys`.
5. Choose rooms on the dungeon map with `Card Quick Select Keys`.
6. Select chests and choose chest rewards with `Card Quick Select Keys`.
7. Select shops and make shop purchases with `Card Quick Select Keys`.
8. Select "Proceed", "Skip", and "Continue" buttons with `End Turn`.
9. Confirm card selection with `End Turn`.

All of these features are optional and can be enabled/disabled in the mod settings.

## Visual Indicators

All new locations for using hotkeys have visual indicators that match the style and appearance of the visual indicators for `Card Quick Select Keys` or the tooltips for the `End Turn` button.

These visual indicators can be enabled/disabled separate from the actual hotkey functionality so if you find the visual indicators make your screen too cluttered you can disable them while still using hotkeys to speed up your gameplay.
